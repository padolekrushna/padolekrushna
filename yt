- Review the **clarity rules** for PAR carefully.
- Examine the **input_field** against each rule.
- The evaluation should not be **case-insensitive**.
- Do NOT flag domain-specific or valid technical terms such as 
  "power-specific capabilities", "frequency-dependent behaviour",
  “system-level constraints”, etc.
- Only flag unclear wording when the sentence structure itself is ambiguous,
  NOT because the phrase introduces a term not defined elsewhere.
