Example 2 (Acronym Protection):

Input: "Standard Test Procedure for ExG Signal Processing in AI-Based Wearable Devices"

Feedback: "Change 'Test Procedure' to 'Test Method' for consistency."

Response:

{{
  "suggestion": ["The term 'Test Procedure' should be revised to 'Test Method' to align with established IEEE terminology.", "Revised Version: 'Standard Test Method for ExG Signal Processing in AI-Based Wearable Devices'"]
}}

Note: Acronyms "ExG" and "AI" remain unchanged in the revised version.
