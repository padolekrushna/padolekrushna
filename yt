      "value": "The stakeholders include technicians, managers, contractors, employees, engineers, operators, supervisors, and administrators who will collaborate on system implementation.",
      "value": "The chairman will coordinate with businessmen, policemen, and firemen to ensure manpower is sufficient for the project implementation.",


      "value": "The primary stakeholders include system engineers, network administrators, database managers, software developers, quality assurance technicians, field operators, maintenance personnel, project supervisors, technical consultants, and end users. The working group chairman will coordinate with the vice-chairman and committee chairmen to establish a manpower allocation plan. Industry representatives include businessmen from manufacturing sectors, spokesmen for utility companies, and congressmen who oversee regulatory compliance. The implementation team consists of policemen for security protocols, firemen for safety assessments, and servicemen who provide operational support. Additionally, the guidance will benefit craftsmen, salesmen, and workmen involved in installation procedures. The project requires seamless collaboration between contractors, employees, subcontractors, suppliers, installers, and all stakeholders to ensure successful deployment.",

**IMPORTANT:** "managers" is NOT gender-specific. Do NOT flag it. Do NOT suggest replacing it with "management" or "supervisors".

**CRITICAL RULE 3 - Suffix Detection (ONLY Flag These Patterns):**
    
✓ FLAG these (gender is the COMPLETE ENDING):
- Words ending in: -man, -men, -woman, -women, -ess
- Standalone compounds: manpower, man-hours, mankind

✗ DO NOT FLAG these (not complete word endings):
- managers → ends with "ers" NOT "man" or "men"
- engineers → ends with "eers" NOT "man" or "men"
- technicians → ends with "ians" NOT "man" or "men"
- operators → ends with "ors" NOT "man" or "men"

**CRITICAL RULE 4 - Suffix Matching Algorithm:**
To determine if a word should be flagged, follow this exact process:

Step 1: Extract the last 3-4 characters of the word
Step 2: Check if it EXACTLY matches: "-man", "-men", "-ess", "-woman", "-women"
Step 3: If YES → flag it. If NO → do NOT flag it.

Examples:
- "chairman" → last 3 chars = "man" → EXACT MATCH → FLAG ✓
- "managers" → last 3 chars = "ers" → NO MATCH → DO NOT FLAG ✗


Example 4 - Tricky case with "managers":
Input: "The project managers and line managers coordinated with the chairman."
Output: {{"analysis": ["The term 'chairman' is gender-specific; using 'chair' ensures inclusivity and neutrality."]}}
Reason: "managers" ends with "-ers" NOT "-man" or "-men", so it is NOT flagged; only chairman is flagged


**FINAL CHECK BEFORE RESPONDING:**
Before providing any feedback, verify:
1. Is the word in the neutral role terms list? → If YES, do NOT flag it
2. Does the word end with EXACTLY -man, -men, -woman, -women, or -ess? → If NO, do NOT flag it
3. Only if both checks pass, then flag the word as gender-specific
