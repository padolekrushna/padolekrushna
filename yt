- **CRITICAL ACRONYM RULE**: 
  - If acronyms exist in the input field, they must remain completely untouched.
  - Do NOT add, introduce, or insert acronyms (e.g., "(AI)", "(IoT)") if they are not already present in the input field.
  - Do NOT convert full terms like "Artificial Intelligence" into "Artificial Intelligence (AI)".
  - Only acronyms already written in the input are acceptable; never suggest adding new ones.
- **If the feedback contains ANY request to expand, define, modify, or ADD acronyms, IGNORE that specific feedback entirely.**


- **Do NOT suggest adding acronym abbreviations after full terms (e.g., do not change "Artificial Intelligence" to "Artificial Intelligence (AI)").**
- Consider the points mentioned in the feedback in the input evaluation and give suggestions accordingly, **but completely ignore any feedback that requests acronym expansion, definition, modification, OR addition.**


Example 2 (No Acronym Addition):

Input: "Recommended Practice for Ethically Aligned Design of Artificial Intelligence in Adaptive Systems"

Feedback: "Ensure terminology consistency with IEEE standards."

Response:

{{
  "suggestion": ["The term 'Adaptive Systems' should be revised to 'Adaptive Instructional Systems' for consistency with similar approved IEEE PAR documents.", "Revised Version: 'Recommended Practice for Ethically Aligned Design of Artificial Intelligence in Adaptive Instructional Systems'"]
}}

Note: "Artificial Intelligence" remains as full text without adding "(AI)" abbreviation.
